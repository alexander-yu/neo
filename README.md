# Neo

A matrix language

by Alex Yu, Andr√©s Aguayo, Ani Bezjian, Dominique Gordon, and Mohamed Abedelmalik

## Installation

- Navigate to root directory of project
- Compile using the command `make`

## Compiling a Neo Program

- Run the command `./neoc [options] [.neo file]`

## Testing

- Compile Neo (see above)
- Run tests using the command `./testall.sh [options] [.neo files]` (see `./testall.sh -h` for help); if no `.neo` files are provided, the test script will automatically validate against all tests in the `test` directory
- Test suite will use the Neo compiler to compile to LLVM, which then links with external C code (see `native.c`) and produces an executable for each test program (specified either by the `[.neo files]` command line argument, or the files in the `test` directory otherwise)
- Tests with the `test-` prefix are positive tests; these tests produce observable output which are compared against gold standard output (`*.out` files)
- Tests with the `fail-` prefix are negative tests; these tests produce error messages which are compared against expected error messages (`*.err` files)
- An overall log of the test results will be produced in addition to console output in `testall.log`
